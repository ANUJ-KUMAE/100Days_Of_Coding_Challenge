Third Maximum Number: 
Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.

Solution: 

class Solution {
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) 
    {
        long firstMax = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        long secondMax = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        long thirdMax = Long.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > firstMax) {
                thirdMax = secondMax;
                secondMax = firstMax;
                firstMax = num;
            } else if (num < firstMax && num > secondMax) {
                thirdMax = secondMax;
                secondMax = num;
            } else if (num < secondMax && num > thirdMax) {
                thirdMax = num;
            }
        }
        return (thirdMax != Long.MIN_VALUE) ? (int) thirdMax : (int) firstMax;
    }  
}
