You are given an integer N. You need to convert all zeroes of N to 5.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 1004
Output: 1554
Explanation: There are two zeroes in 1004
on replacing all zeroes with "5", the new
number will be "1554".
Example 2:

Input:
N = 121
Output: 121
Explanation: Since there are no zeroes in
"121", the number remains as "121".
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function convertFive() which takes an integer N as an argument and replaces all zeros in the number N with 5. Your function should return the converted number.

Expected Time Complexity: O(K) where K is the number of digits in N
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Solution:
class GfG {
    int convertfive(int num) 
    {
        int a=0,temp=0,ans=0;
        while(num>0)
        {
            a=num%10;
            if(a==0)
            {
                a=5;
            }
            temp = temp * 10 + a;
            num = num / 10;
        }
        while (temp > 0)
        {
           int rem = temp % 10;
           ans = ans * 10 + rem;
           temp = temp / 10;
        }
    return ans;
    }
}
