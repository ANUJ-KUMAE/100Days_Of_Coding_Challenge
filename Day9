HashMap is a part of collection in Java. It provides the basic implementation of Map interface of Java. It stores the data in (Key, Value) pairs. To access a value you must know its key, otherwise, you canâ€™t access it. HashMap is known as HashMap because it uses the technique called Hashing. Solve the following problem using a HashMap.

Given two arrays key[] and arr[] of size N and a key s. Each key[i] and arr[i] form a key-value pair. Find if the value of S in the N key-value pairs. 

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
keys = {sak, varun, vijay}
arr = {5, 7, 3}
s = sak
Output: 5
Explaination: The key is present in the map. 
So its corresponding value is returned which 
is 5.
 

Example 2:

Input: n = 4
keys = {csdb, dsh, askj, adfs}
arr = {4, 5, 8, 9}
s = dptu
Output: -1
Explaination: 
The key is not present in the map.
 

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Yous task is to complete the function map() which takes n, keys[], arr[] and s as input parameters and returns the value associated with the key s. If the key is not present return -1.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Solution:

class Solution{
    static int map(int n, String keys[], int arr[], String s)
    {
        HashMap<String,Integer> HM = new HashMap<>();
        int len = keys.length;
        int a=0;
        for(int i=0;i<len;i++)
        {
            HM.put(keys[i],arr[i]);
        }
        if(HM.containsKey(s))
        {
            a = HM.get(s);
        }
        else
        {
           a=-1; 
        }
        return a;
    }
}
