Java provides an inbuilt object type called Stack. It is a collection that is based on the last in first out (LIFO) principle. Try this problem using Stack. 

Given n elements of a stack st where the first value is the bottom-most value of the stack and the last one is the element at top of the stack, delete the middle element of the stack without using any additional data structure.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5
st = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 5 4 2 1
Explaination: The middle element is 3. If 
it is deleted and then the values are seen 
from top, this will be the order.
 

Example 2:

Input: n = 6
st = {1, 4, 9, 2, 6, 5}
Output: 5 6 2 4 1
Explaination: The middle element is 9 and if 
it is deleted this will be the stack traversal. 
 

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function deleteMid() which takes n and st as input parameters and returns a stack where the middle element is deleted.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

solution:

class Solution{
    static Stack<Integer> deleteMid(int n, Stack<Integer> st)
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        Stack<Integer> sr = new Stack<>();
        if(n%2 == 0)
        {
           int mid = (n/2)-1;
           for(int i=0;i<=n-1;i++)
           {
               if(i==mid)
               {
                   continue;
               }
               sr.push(st.get(i));
           }
        }
        else
        {
            int mid1 = (n-1)/2;
            for(int i=0;i<=n-1;i++)
            {
                if(i==mid1)
                {
                    continue;
                }
                sr.push(st.get(i));
            }
        }
     return sr;
    }
}
